EZOpen 1.0
Help Document

Purpose:
Every person who works extensively on computer does not want to restart the computer
because so many softwares/utilities opened on computer. He/she does not want to open again.
EZOpen targets this inconvenience perfectly. You need to set the shortcuts in the EZOpen
shortcuts dashboard and on execute those software and utilities get opened automatically one
after another.

Working:
1. Add shortcut:
a. For adding the shortcut information of any software or utility, you need to find the
.exe/application path of that software/utility.
b. Copy that path.
c. Open EZOpen and click on Add Shortcut
d. Now you can see a text box is added in Shortcut Dashboard. Paste the .exe path in
the text box. You can add as many shortcuts as you want.
e. Now click on Execute button and all the software/s will be opened one by one.

2. Remove Shortcuts:
If you do not want specific shortcut to open, you can remove it just by clicking the
Remove button near the textbox of that shortcut. 

3. Add command prompt:
a. The important feature of EZOpen is user can open command prompt and run the
command in it through EZOpen.
b. Select the checkbox “Command Prompt” besides the Add Shortcut button.
c. Now click the Add Shortcut button. This will add the command prompt short cut in
the Shortcuts Dashboard.
d. To run the commands in the command prompt on run, you need to write the
command. For this, click on the Editor Button of that command prompt shortcut.
This button activates the editor.
e. Now add the commands in the editor.
f. On execute, the command prompt will be opened and the entered commands in the
editor will be run in the opened command prompt.
g. You can add the command prompts as many as you want.

4. Open Documents
Like the path of .exe/application of software or utilities, you can add the path of the
documents in the shortcut textbox. On execute, the documents also get opened. 

5. Save the settings:
a. It is very troublesome to add the shortcuts every time you open the EZOpen. Save
Settings option helps in this case.
b. Save Settings option is available in the File menu. Click the submenu “Save
Settings”. This will save the added shortcuts added in the Shortcuts Dashboard on
the computer.
c. Next time user open EZOpen, it will be opened with these saved settings. Also, the
commands entered in the editor of the command prompt will also be available.

6. Clear the Settings:
If the user wants to clear all the settings, then a submenu “Clear All” is available in File
menu. Click it and shortcuts from the ShortCuts Dashboard will disappear.
